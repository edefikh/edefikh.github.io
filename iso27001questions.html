        <li>Who is responsible for maintaining and improving the ISMS?</li>
        <li>What is your leadership’s commitment to ISO 27001 compliance?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Governance & Documentation</h2>
    <ul>

        <li>When was the last time policies were reviewed and approved?</li>
        <li>How do you communicate security policies to employees?</li>
        <li>Do you have an asset inventory of all critical IT systems and data?</li>
        <li>What security training and awareness programs are in place?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Risk Management & Internal Audits</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Have you conducted a formal <strong>risk assessment</strong> based on ISO 27001 requirements?</li>

        <li>Do you have a documented <strong>risk treatment plan</strong>?</li>
        <li>When was the last time an <strong>internal audit</strong> was conducted?</li>
        <li>Have previous internal audits identified any major <strong>non-conformities</strong>? If so, how were they handled?</li>
        <li>How do you track corrective and preventive actions?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Technical & Operational Security Controls</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Do you follow Annex A controls (A.5–A.18) in <strong>ISO/IEC 27001:2022</strong>?</li>
        <li>How are access controls managed (e.g., role-based access, least privilege)?</li>
        <li>Are security configurations regularly reviewed and updated?</li>
        <li>What is your approach to <strong>vulnerability management</strong> and <strong>patching</strong>?</li>
        <li>How is <strong>data encryption</strong> handled (at rest and in transit)?</li>
        <li>Do you conduct <strong>security monitoring</strong> and <strong>incident detection</strong>?</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>6. Audit History & Lessons Learned</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>What findings did the last <strong>ISO 27001 audit</strong> uncover?</li>
