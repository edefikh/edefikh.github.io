    <h2>Crypto Security Risks & Mitigation Strategies</h2>

    <h2>Smart Contract Vulnerabilities</h2>
    <p>Smart contracts, once deployed, are immutable, meaning any coding errors or vulnerabilities remain permanent. Common risks include:</p>
    
    <h3>Common Vulnerabilities:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Reentrancy Attacks:</strong> An attacker exploits an external call in a contract to repeatedly withdraw funds before the balance updates.</li>
        <li><strong>Integer Overflow/Underflow:</strong> Poorly managed numerical calculations can result in unintended values, leading to loss of funds.</li>
        <li><strong>Logic Errors:</strong> Flaws in contract logic can lead to exploits such as unauthorized fund transfers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Mitigation Strategies:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Code Audits:</strong> Conduct thorough security audits with reputable firms before deploying a contract.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Established Libraries:</strong> Leverage secure libraries such as OpenZeppelin to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Implement Reentrancy Guards:</strong> Use the <code>checks-effects-interactions</code> pattern and reentrancy guards to prevent recursive calls.</li>
        <li><strong>Limit Contract Permissions:</strong> Minimize the contractâ€™s privileges and access controls to reduce exploit risk.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Private Key Security</h2>
    <p>Private keys control access to crypto assets. Losing a key or exposing it to attackers results in irreversible losses.</p>

    <h3>Common Risks:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Phishing Attacks:</strong> Attackers trick users into revealing private keys or seed phrases through fake websites or emails.</li>
        <li><strong>Malware & Keyloggers:</strong> Malicious software can record keystrokes and steal credentials.</li>
        <li><strong>Poor Storage Practices:</strong> Storing private keys in plain text files, cloud storage, or insecure locations can lead to theft.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Mitigation Strategies:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Hardware Wallets:</strong> Store private keys offline in hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor.</li>
        <li><strong>Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Use 2FA for exchanges and wallets to add an extra security layer.</li>
        <li><strong>Beware of Phishing:</strong> Verify URLs and avoid clicking suspicious links or downloading unknown attachments.</li>
        <li><strong>Secure Backup Storage:</strong> Store seed phrases in a fireproof, offline location such as a safe.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Exchange Hacks</h2>
    <p>Cryptocurrency exchanges are frequent targets for hackers due to the high concentration of funds.</p>

    <h3>Common Risks:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Centralized Control:</strong> Most exchanges hold users' private keys, making them a single point of failure.</li>
        <li><strong>Insider Threats:</strong> Employees or compromised personnel can leak sensitive data.</li>
        <li><strong>Poor Security Practices:</strong> Weak encryption, lack of cold storage, and outdated security protocols increase vulnerabilities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Mitigation Strategies:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Reputable Exchanges:</strong> Choose exchanges with strong security measures, cold storage, and insurance policies.</li>
        <li><strong>Withdraw to a Private Wallet:</strong> Store long-term holdings in private wallets instead of leaving them on exchanges.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor Exchange Security Practices:</strong> Ensure the exchange implements 2FA, withdrawal whitelisting, and account monitoring.</li>
        <li><strong>Diversify Assets:</strong> Avoid keeping all funds in one exchange to minimize risk exposure.</li>
    </ul>
