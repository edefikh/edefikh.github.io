    <h2>Crypto Security Risks</h2>

    <h2>Smart Contract Vulnerabilities</h2>
    <p>Smart contracts, once deployed, are immutable, making coding errors and vulnerabilities permanent risks. Exploits such as reentrancy attacks, integer overflows, and logic flaws can lead to the loss of funds.</p>

    <h2>Private Key Security</h2>
    <p>Private keys grant full control over crypto assets. Weak storage practices, phishing attacks, malware, and social engineering can lead to unauthorized access and fund theft.</p>

    <h2>Exchange Hacks</h2>
    <p>Cryptocurrency exchanges are prime targets for hackers. Poor security practices, insider threats, and vulnerabilities in centralized exchanges have led to significant losses of digital assets.</p>
