    <h2>Difference Between SOC 2 and ISO 27001</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Purpose and Focus</h3>
    <p><strong>SOC 2:</strong> A framework developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (<strong>AICPA</strong>) that focuses on the security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy of customer data. It's specifically designed for technology and cloud computing companies that provide services to other businesses.</p>
    <p><strong>ISO 27001:</strong> An international standard for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an <strong>Information Security Management System (ISMS)</strong>. It provides a risk-based approach to security management applicable to organizations of all types.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Certification vs. Attestation</h3>
    <p><strong>SOC 2:</strong> Provides an <strong>attestation report</strong> issued by a CPA firm, assessing whether an organization's security controls meet the required Trust Service Criteria.</p>
    <p><strong>ISO 27001:</strong> Offers a <strong>formal certification</strong> issued by accredited bodies, proving compliance with the standard.</p>
    
    <h3>3. Geographic and Industry Adoption</h3>
    <p><strong>SOC 2:</strong> Primarily used in <strong>North America</strong>, especially for cloud-based service providers and SaaS companies.</p>
    <p><strong>ISO 27001:</strong> More widely recognized <strong>globally</strong>, applicable across all industries, including finance, healthcare, and manufacturing.</p>
    
    <h3>4. Scope and Structure</h3>
    <p><strong>SOC 2:</strong> Focuses on controls relevant to <strong>customer data protection</strong>, specifically tailored to the service organization's commitments.</p>
    <p><strong>ISO 27001:</strong> Covers <strong>a broader set of security controls</strong> across the entire organization, including <strong>risk assessment, governance, policies, and continuous improvement</strong>.</p>
    
    <h3>5. Audit and Assessment</h3>
    <p><strong>SOC 2:</strong> Two types of reports:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Type I:</strong> A point-in-time assessment of security controls.</li>
        <li><strong>Type II:</strong> An evaluation over a period (typically 3-12 months) to assess operational effectiveness.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>ISO 27001:</strong> Requires an initial certification audit and <strong>ongoing surveillance audits</strong> (typically annual) to maintain compliance.</p>
    
    <h2>When to Choose SOC 2 vs. ISO 27001?</h2>
    
    <h3>✅ Choose SOC 2 if:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You’re a <strong>cloud service provider or SaaS company</strong> selling to U.S.-based businesses.</li>
        <li>Your customers request <strong>SOC 2 reports</strong> as proof of security compliance.</li>
        <li>You need to demonstrate security but don’t necessarily require an <strong>ISO certification</strong>.</li>
        <li>You prefer a framework that evaluates <strong>customer-facing security controls</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>✅ Choose ISO 27001 if:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You operate <strong>internationally</strong> or work with European and global businesses.</li>
        <li>You need a <strong>structured and comprehensive security management system</strong> beyond IT controls.</li>
        <li>You want a <strong>recognized security certification</strong> that applies across industries.</li>
        <li>You’re in a <strong>regulated industry</strong> that requires a more standardized approach.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Can You Have Both?</h3>
    <p>Yes! Many companies pursue <strong>both SOC 2 and ISO 27001</strong> to cover different compliance needs. For example, a U.S.-based SaaS company expanding internationally might first obtain SOC 2 to meet U.S. client expectations and then pursue ISO 27001 for global credibility.</p>
